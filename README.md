📩 **SMS Spam Predictor**


Detect Spam Messages with Machine Learning


🔗 Repository: parthvasu2004/sms_spam_predictor_p


🚀 Overview


The SMS Spam Predictor is a machine learning-based web application designed to detect spam messages efficiently. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify SMS messages as either Spam or Ham (Not Spam).


🛠️ Features


✔️ Machine Learning Model: Uses a pre-trained model stored in model.pkl for classification.
✔️ TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text messages into numerical format using vectorizer.pkl.
✔️ Flask Web Application: A simple and interactive web interface to test SMS classification.
✔️ Fast & Efficient: Predicts in real-time with minimal latency.
